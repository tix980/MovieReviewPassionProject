## Introduction

Hello everyone, thank you for checking out this project's repository. This project is basically a movie review website. 
Before users go to the cinema and watch a movie. They can simple visit my website to find out if the movie will worth their money and time.
The last thing that they want to watch is a bad movie like cats. They can also check actors' bio pages to see what movies that they have been participated in.
Log-in admins have the ability to do changes to the movie database such as adding new movies, updating selected actor's information, removing reviews with inappropriate
information. I hope you will enjoy using my website. If you have any questions about this project, please feel free to contact me.
